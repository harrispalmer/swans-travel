<h3>Butchart Gardens</h3>
<hr>
<p><i>Over one million people visit the world-famous Butchart Gardens annually. The National Historic Site of Canada is home to five main gardens: the Rose, Japanese, Italian, Mediterranean and Sunken Gardens. <p></p>The latter was the first project
    that
    the Butcharts developed many years ago, as it was previously a quarry. <p></p>The best thing about Butchart Gardens is that they look impressive in every season, even in winter when they are decorated with thousands of twinkling lights.</i></p>
